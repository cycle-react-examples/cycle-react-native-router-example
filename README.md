# Example of React-Native Router with Cycle-React

A demo app showing how to implement navigation with [Cycle-React] within the React Native environment.

## Disclaimer

This repository was modified from [jlyman/RN-NavigationExperimental-Redux-Example](https://github.com/jlyman/RN-NavigationExperimental-Redux-Example).
Most of code was borrowed from @jlyman's work. This demo app was reimplemented for [Cycle-React] and had no redux dependency, however.
